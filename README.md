# glitch
A simple program to apply common glitch effects to an image.
Requires ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org)

I'm running on an arch machine, I just had to install ImageMagick through pacman. 
Your milage may varry based upon your OS and such.

This has been tested on ImageMagick 6.9.2.0-1.

Plans and ideas:
  - Moar effects!
      - General curruption of the image, including artifacting.
  - GUI
